# AR-Ball-Maze
This is an augmented reality that mocks the traditional ball-in-maze game. 

# Tech stack:
            Unity (Game engine)
            C# (scripting animation)

# How to play:
            
            To play you will need to download Unity, and print the file labeled     (This is your maze)
            Next you simply need to clone the repository and open  in Unity.
            Once you hit play, your laptops camera will be used to recognize the maze.
            Your goal is to get the ball through the maze without it falling out. Good luck
